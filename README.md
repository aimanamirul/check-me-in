# Check-Me-In

## What the App Is and What It Does

Check-Me-In is a daily check-in app for you to stay organized and focused. Currently included are a note module for jotting down important reminders and a To-Do module for managing tasks. The app is built using React, TypeScript, and Vite on Bun. Designed to be modular in mind, more modules will be added in future releases.

Also powered by Supabase.
